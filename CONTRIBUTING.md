Before submitting, please read the Contributing to Ruby on Rails guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about our rationales behind this decision).
